C++ vulkan api generator
========================

Generates a C++ api from the vulkan spec.
__Comparison__ to [vulkan-hpp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp):

- vkpp created with simplicity and compile-time in mind, more lightweight
	- does NOT produce a monolithic almost 30K LOC header
	- splits usage into multiple headers, which allows you to
	  e.g. only use the forward-declarations (less than 1K LOC) in
	  your public headers
	- fewer features
		- does not model everything object-oriented
		- no automatic 'to_string' functions for enums
		- probably less sophisticated error handling
- Does only offer real advantages over the plain C api
	- putting everything in a namespace
	- typesafe enums
	- automatic critical error checking
	- structure constructors (sType settings, default initialization)
	- 'vectorization' of functions
		- ```vk::queueSubmit(queue, {info1, info2, info3}, fence)``` is valid
- Has a different (optional) dynamic dispatch mechanism. vkpp allows to
  dynamically dispatch implicitly if you wish so (could be useful for android)
- Disadvantage: not shipped with vulkan sdk/vulkan package
	- this means you might get issues with version compatibilities
	  using this api (just use the correct git tag matching your installed
	  vulkan.h version for your projects)

If you need one of the not supported features mentioned above, check
out vulkan-hpp (or if you think they are reasonable here, describe
them with reasoning in an issue).
Issue reports, contributions and suggestions appreciated!

# Versioning

You can change the vulkan version for which the headers are generated by
replacing the `vk.xml` with the version you want to use.
Note that you have to configure meson with `-Dregen=true` (or
`-Dvkpp:regen=true` if you are using vkpp as subproject) to
regenerate the headers. The current generator does also not support
all versions since the vulkan xml spec format has some significant
(not backwards-compatible) changes over time.
For some vulkan versions, there are specific git commits you may simply use.
